Singleton Overview

Singleton is 
    a component which is instantiated only once

Motivation
    
    For some components it only makes sense to have one instance in the system
        - database repository, because you dont want to read it a zillion times
        - object fatory, because factory isnt suppose to have any state

    E.g., the constructor call is expensive
        - we only do it once
        - once constructed, we provide everyone with the same instance

    Want to prevent anyone creating additional copies
    
    Need to take care of lazy instantiation and thread safety
