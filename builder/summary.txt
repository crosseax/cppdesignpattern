Builder 

A builder is a separate component whose only purpose is to build an object

Can either give builder a constructor 
    thereby letting it exist as a separate standalone component 
    that somebody instantiates and then use this build something
or return it via a static function or static getter 
    from the component that you're trying to build

To make a builder fluent, which is a good idea, because you can chain them together, return *this

Different facets of an object can be built with different builders working in tandem via a base class
    this is becuase they share a base class that allows the client to switch from one builder to another
