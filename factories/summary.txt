Factories 

A factory method is a static method that creates objects

A factory can take care of object creation
    so it's a separate class/component which can take care exclusively of the object creation 
    so this is kind of the single responsibility principle taken to its limit
    because you taken an object, and the constructor isn't good enough, so you use factory

A factory can be external or reside inside the object as an inner class
    as a nested class, there're certain benefits such as access to the private member etc.
    otherwise you're declaring the factory to be a friend class of whatever you're creating (but this could potentially break OCP which is not good)

Hierarchies of factories can be used to create related objects
    not very common nowadays
    the second half of the design pattern of factory according to Gang of Four
