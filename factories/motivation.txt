Factories

Motivation for this

Constructor is not descriptive
    Name mandated by name of containing type
    Cannot overload with same sets of arguments with different names
    Can turn into "opttional parameter hell"

Object creation (non-piecewise, unlike Builder) can be ousourced to 
    A separate function (Factory Method)
    That may exist in a separate class (Factory)
    Can create hierarchy of factories with Abstract Factory


Factory:
    Acomponent responsible solely for the wholesale creation of objects
    (not piecewise, which is left to Builder)
