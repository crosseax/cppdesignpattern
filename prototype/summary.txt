Prototype Summary

    To implement a prototype, partially construct an object and store it somehwere
        
    Clone the prototype
        
        1. Implement your own deep copy functionality;
            - do it by yourself, for example, by making copy constructor yourself
            - or making some sort of prototype interface and defining a deep copy member on that interface
              and then implementing that interface in every single object of the entire hierarchy that you want to copy
            - this is a relatively complicated way
        
        2. Serialize and deserialize
            - serialization is a very useful way because it traverse the entire object graph
            - this is a relatively simple way of actually making the deep copy of an object

    Customize the resulting instance
        - then you can start using your code
