Prototype

A prototype design pattern is all about object copying
Apartially of fully initiaized object that you copy (clone) and make use of


Motivation
    - Complicated objects are NOT designed from scratch
        essentially they reiterate existing designs, making them better
    - An existing (partially or fully constructed) design is a Prototype
    - We make a copy (clone) the prototype and customize it
        requires 'deep copy' support
        a point you're copying all the object references by making new objects which replicate the state of those references
        and you doing it recursively
        so changing the object does NOT affect the object it just copied
    - We have to make cloning convenient (e.g. via factory)
